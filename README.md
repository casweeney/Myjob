------------------HOW THE WEBSITE WORKS-------------------
Many Job seekers who are know how to carry out a particular job don't usually have opportunities to do such job,
because they don't have access or contact to people who may be in demand of their services.

Similarly, Job providers may be in need of professional who are specialized in handling a particular job well but
might end up giving the job to someone who may not handle it to their satisfaction.

Myjob now comes in as a bridge between this existing gaps their by giving job seekers to advertise themselves and
get hired and also allowing job providers to advertise their job opportunities qualified persons to apply.
